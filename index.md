`dHjpc21|Z2|zdhVz  `→ Trismegitus → Father of Alchemy<br>
`cHJpbmNpcGx|      `→ Principle  → Could refer to the principles of alchemy<br>
`d29tYg==          `→ Womb → Most likely refers to creation or transformation possibly the [alembic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alembic)<br>
##### Working Notes (*NOT CONCRETE*) : 
HeckTeck keeps mentioning Alchemy… this appears to reference both the archaic science and the C Dialect.(*I do not know either*)<br>
Someone noted that the symbols on the skulls may be [alchemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemical_symbol).<br>

Midas my muse?<br>
![Alt view of lion statue](images/image5.png)<br>
The image appears to be a statue of a lion with the head of a sun, and the face of a man. The head has fallen off and lies upside down on the ground.<br>
Topical research indicates Iranian origins.<br>
~~I cannot find how this could be relevant to the title screen code.~~ <br>
This could be a reference to the alchemical imagery of aqua regia, a green lion attacking the sun. Where the lion is the aqua regia attacking/consuming the sun which is the gold (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suns_in_alchemy)

The Code: (Note - according to Heckteck there are 1-2 typos that should be fixed in an update)<br>
